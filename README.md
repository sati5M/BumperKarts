The ticket master options are regarding the ped who will be there to "sell the tickets" to the player who wants to join the game.

Make sure to change the vehicle model and the spawn locations or else it'll bug. You also need to make sure that you have the same or more locations than your max players or players will start to spawn on top of each other.

The game settings are very self explanatory and you can edit the code yourself if you'd like to add costs to play the game.
